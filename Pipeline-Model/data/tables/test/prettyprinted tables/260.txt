| http://www.timeref.com/library/medieval_ |             | The Count of Champagne was preparing to |
| knights_templar_timeline.htm             |             | travel to the Holy Land when he         |
|                                          |             | received a letter from the bishop of    |
|                                          |             | Chartres. The letter stated that the    |

|                                          |             | Templars ?). This seems to indicate     |
|                                          |             | that the order existed at this time, as |
