But internally, it offers the same A9 processor and improved camera as the iPhone 6S, making it a pretty good deal for those who don’t mind (or even prefer) the smaller size. The screen isn’t quite as nice as larger-sized iPhones and Touch ID is slower, but the iPhone X doesn’t even have Touch ID, so something is better than nothing."

It’s got the same design, with a choice of a 4.7-inch screen on the 6S, or a 5.5-inch display on the 6S Plus. There’s also support for Apple’s 3D Touch feature, and you get the ability to take animated Live Photos. Those two things, combined with a faster processor, are the main differentiators compared to the older 6."

Along with the processor boost (to an A10 Fusion chip), the 7 line also added IP67 water resistance."

At starting prices of $699 and $799, respectively, they’re the most expensive base costs for any iPhone yet."

It also has the improvements of the iPhone 8, including wireless charging and the new A11 Bionic chip. But at a starting price of $999 (not including taxes), customers on a budget might want to consider some of Apple’s older — and far, far cheaper — options instead. Or at least"
