The optimum aquarium temperature for Horned Nerite Snails is around 70째F - 80째F (21째C-27째C).,Horned Nerite Snails require pH between about 6.5 and 8.; Relative water hardness for Horned Nerite Snails should be in the range of 6-12dH. Horned Nerite Snails are hardy species and are able to withstand captivity fluctuations.,"Horned Nerite Snails can grow up to 1"" but are often found at a maximum size of 3/4"". They are suitable for medium sized aquariums.",Nitrite should always be 0.,Horned Nerite Snails are sensitive to ammonia spikes.,Nitrates should be as close to 0ppm as possible. Horned Nerite Snails consume debris contributing to lower nitrates.,Horned Nerite Snails are excellent at consuming debris and algae. However in large numbers they will require extra food. For this reason it is wise to stock no more than one snail for every 4 gallons of aquarium water. Horned Nerite Snails have a short captive life of approximately one year. For this reason it is wise to slowly re-purchase snails throughout the year as Horned Nerite Snails cannot reproduce in freshwater.,Horned Nerite Snails can simply be fed commercial flake and pellet food. They only require supplemental feeding if there is no debris or algae left to consume. They are efficient cleaners and will leave the glass and substrate very clean. They are not fussy eaters. The filter should be turned off during feeding to allow the food to float to the substrate where it is easily accessible for the Horned Nerite Snails.,"Horned Nerite Snails will not breed in freshwater aquariums. Horned Nerite Snails will only breed in brackish waters and even then raising young is difficult. Young successfully raised in captivity have far lower life expectancies than those wild caught. On the upside, Horned Nerite Snails will not overpopulate the aquarium making them far easier maintenance than other species."
