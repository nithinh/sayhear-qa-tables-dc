"Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) is the unemployment rate consistent with maintaining stable inflation. According to the standard macroeconomic theory, inflation will tend to rise if the unemployment rate falls below the natural rate. Conversely, when the unemployment rate rises above the natural rate, inflation tends to fall. Thus, the natural rate and the NAIRU are often viewed as two names for the same thing, providing an important benchmark for gauging the state of the business cycle, the outlook for future inflation, and the appropriate stance of monetary policy.","During the severe recession of 1974-75 both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate reached some of the highest levels in postwar U.S. history. This experience shook public faith in Keynesianism and played a key role in shaping the subsequent debate about inflation. The warnings of Milton Friedman and other monetarists that attempts to “ride the Phillips curve” might lead to accelerating inflation began to be heeded by more and more people, both inside and outside the ranks of professional economists. The credibility of the monetarist alternative to Keynesian theory was greatly strengthened.","The simplest theoretical framework incorporating the NAIRU concept in a transparent fashion is the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, which is also consistent with a variety of alternative structural models. The Phillips curve also has a long empirical tradition of being used as a means of estimating NAIRU indicators. Refinements of the empirical specification led Gordon (1997) to summarize it in terms of the so-called “triangle model” with inflation being determined by three factors: built-in inflation, demand-pull inflation, and cost-push inflation.",Phillips Curve
