Contribute to retirement accounts,"If you haven’t already funded your retirement account for 2017, do so by April 17, 2018. That’s the deadline for contributions to a traditional IRA, deductible or not, and to a Roth IRA."

Make a last-minute estimated tax payment,"If you didn’t pay enough to the IRS during the year, you may have a big tax bill staring you in the face. Plus, you might owe significant interest and penalties, too."

But there are other rewards, and some of them are financial. For many, the biggest hassle at tax time is getting all of the documentation together. This includes last year’s tax return, this year’s W-2s and 1099s, receipts and so on."

Instead, you can go right to the source online. View and download a large catalog of forms and publications at the Internal Revenue Service Web site or have them sent to you by mail. You can search for documents as far back as 1980 by number or by date."

https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-planning-and-checklists/tax-tips-after-january-1st/L8fY6OyFl,6. Don't shy away from a home office tax deduction,"The eligibility rules for claiming a home office deduction have been loosened to allow more filers to claim this break. People who have no fixed location for their businesses can claim a home office deduction if they use the space for administrative or management activities, even if they don’t meet clients there. Doctors, for example, who consult at various hospitals, or plumbers who make house calls, can now qualify. As always, you must use the space exclusively for business."

Provide dependent taxpayer IDs on your tax return,"Be sure to plug in Taxpayer Identification Numbers (usually Social Security Numbers) for your children and other dependents on your return. Otherwise, the IRS will deny the personal exemption of $4,050 in 2017 for each dependent and the $1,000 child tax credit for each child under age 17."

File and pay on time,"If you can’t finish your return on time, make sure you file Form 4868 by April 17, 2018. Form 4868 gives you a six-month extension of the filing deadline until October 15, 2018. On the form, you need to make a reasonable estimate of your tax liability for 2017 and pay any balance due with your request."
https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-planning-and-checklists/tax-tips-after-january-1st/L8fY6OyFl,9. File electronically,"Electronic filing works best if you expect a tax refund. Because the IRS processes electronic returns faster than paper ones, you can expect to get your refund three to six weeks earlier. If you have all your documents in order, go ahead and file electronically in January using software like one of the TurboTax programs. If you have your refund deposited directly into your bank account or IRA, the waiting time is even less."

Decide if you need help,"TurboTax can handle the most complex returns with ease (and allow you to file your taxes electronically for a faster refund). You just need to answer simple questions, such as whether you've had a baby, bought a home or had some other life-changing event in the past year."
