Self-employed people are responsible for paying the same federal income taxes as everyone else.,"When you work for someone else, you get a W-2 form from your employer at the end of the year telling you exactly how much money you made. When you're self-employed, you have to figure that out yourself. That means you must keep accurate records of how much money you earn for the work you do and how much you spend to operate your business.","In addition to income taxes, everyone must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. If you are self-employed you need to make these tax payments yourself since you don’t have an employer to send it in for you. For 2017, employees pay 7.65 percent of their income in Social Security and Medicare taxes with their employers making an additional payment of 7.65 percent. The Social Security portion of the tax is paid on the first $127,200 of employment income in 2017.","When you're an employee, your employer withholds money for federal taxes out of your paychecks and sends the money to the IRS, so that by the end of the year, your anticipated tax bill should already be substantially paid. If you're self-employed, however, this is another task you have to take care of yourself.","If you have a ""regular job"" in addition to your self-employment, you may be able to increase your federal tax withholding at that job to cover the taxes on your self-employment income. If you can do so, you won't have to pay estimated taxes. However, if you still owe at least $1,000 even after increasing your withholding, then you must make some estimated tax payments. By year's end, your estimated payments (including employer withholding) must equal at least 90 percent of your tax liability for the current year or 100 percent of your tax liability from last year. If it doesn’t, you may be subject to an estimated tax penalty."
