Hypertension_Glossary
url,Term,Definition
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,": One kind of medicine used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) by preventing the body from making the hormone angiotensin II. This hormone causes blood vessels to narrow, which can raise blood pressure. ACE inhibitors allow the vessels to expand (widen) and allow more blood to flow to the heart, which lowers blood pressure. These medicines are also used to treat congestive heart failure, to protect the kidneys in people with diabetes, and to treat people who have had a heart attack. They might also be used to help prevent heart attacks and strokes in high-risk individuals."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Atherosclerosis,": The build-up of fatty deposits within the arteries, eventually causing a blockage of blood flow or stiffening of the artery walls."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Balloon angioplasty,: A procedure in which a small balloon at the tip of the catheter (see cardiac catheterization) is inflated inside a narrowed artery to stretch it open and increase blood flow.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Beta blockers,": One kind of medicine used to treat hypertension, chest pain, and irregular heartbeat, and to help prevent future heart attacks. Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of adrenaline in various parts of the body. They lower the heart rate and relieve stress to the heart so that it requires less blood and oxygen. The heart doesn’t have to work as hard, which lowers blood pressure. Beta blockers also work on blood vessels to relax the vessel walls and lower blood pressure."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Calcium channel blockers,: One kind of hypertension medicine that slows the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and the walls of the arteries (blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the tissues). This relaxes the arteries and reduces the pressure in the blood vessels. Some calcium channel blockers also lower the heart rate.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Cardiac catheterization,: A procedure in which a catheter (a small flexible tube) is inserted into an artery and guided to the arteries in the heart to look for blockages and determine pressure and blood flow in the heart.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Carotid artery,: An artery on the neck that supplies blood to the brain.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Carotid endarterectomy,: Surgery to remove plaque in the carotid artery.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Computed tomography (CT) scan,": A test during which an X-ray beam rotates around the patient, and detectors measure the amount of X-rays that go through the patient. A computer constructs a cross-sectional image of the data."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Congestive heart failure,": The inability of the heart to adequately pump blood. This can be caused by a number of factors, including untreated hypertension and heart attacks."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Corticosteroids,": Natural hormones, or a group of drugs that are similar to the natural hormones produced by the adrenal glands.

https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Diastolic blood pressure,: The lowest pressure of blood against the walls of the arteries when the heart relaxes between beats.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Diuretics,": One kind of medicine used to treat hypertension. Diuretics act on the kidneys to remove excess salt from the blood. This increases the flow of urine and the need to urinate. This, in turn, reduces the amount of water in the body, which helps lower blood pressure."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Echocardiogram,: A test that uses a device to bounce sound waves off the heart to create an image. The image shows the blood flow in the heart’s chambers.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG),": A diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity, rate, and rhythm of the heartbeat via electrodes that are attached to the patient’s arms, legs, and chest."
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Essential hypertension,: High blood pressure that does not have an apparent cause. The vast majority (95%) of high blood pressure is essential hypertension.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Exercise stress test,: A test in which electrocardiogram readings are taken while the patient exercises on a treadmill or stationary bicycle to increase the heart rate to a predetermined point.
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12273-hypertension-glossary,Erythropoietin,: A hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. It is used to treat anemia caused by chronic (long-term) diseases.
